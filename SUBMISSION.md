## Solution
**Platform:** {Android}
**Features:**

2. {Displays markers on a map}
**Build Steps:**
- {N/A}
**What went well or wrong:**
- {It was interesting to learn a whole new language on the spot. We had never coded in Kotlin before so starting off and coming up with something somewhat functional was a huge learning opportunity }
- {However that also made it more difficult to program features that would otherwise be relatively easy in Java}
**What you are proud or disappointed of:**
- {We're proud that we have something working made from a completely new language}
- {We're sad we couldn't get more done}
